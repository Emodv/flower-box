- **Node.js**: Backend server is built with Node.js for handling business logic and database operations.
- **MySQL**: Database used for storing product information, user data, and orders.
- **TypeScript**: Entire project is developed using TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version >= 14)
